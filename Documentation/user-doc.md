# WeApp: How-To

## Introduction 

WeApp is a repository of applications, which can be understand as a library of applications that is sortable and filterable based on different criteria. 
WeApp is different from platform-specific stores in that it provides more information, includes user discussions, is user-driven, and allows cross-platform comparison.
