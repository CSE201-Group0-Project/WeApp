# WeApp
JoJo Technology's (CSE201 Group 0) App Repository 

WeApp is a repository of applications, which can be understand as a library of applications that is sortable and filterable based on different criteria. 
WeApp is different from platform-specific stores in that it provides more information, includes user discussions, is user-driven, and allows cross-platform comparison.
